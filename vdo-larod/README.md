# A combined vdo stream and larod based ACAP3 application running inference on an edge device
This README file explains how to build an ACAP3 application that uses:
- vdo to fetch frames from e.g. a camera
- a library called libyuv to do image preprocessing
- [larod API](../FAQs.md#WhatisLarod?) to load a graph model and run classification inferences on it

It is achieved by using the containerized API and toolchain images.

Together with this README file you should be able to find a directory called app. That directory contains the "vdo_larod" application source code, which can easily
be compiled and run with the help of the tools and step by step below.

## Detailed outline of example application
This application opens a client to vdo and starts fetching frames (in a new thread) in the yuv format. It tries to match twice the WIDTH and HEIGHT that is required by the neural network. The thread fetching frames is written so that it always tries to provide a frame as new as possible even if not all previous frames have been processed by libyuv and larod. The implementation of the vdo specific parts of the app can be found in file "imgprovider.c".

The image preprocessing is then started by libyuv in "imgconverter.c". The code will perform the following three steps:
1. Convert the full size NV12 image delivered by vdo to interleaved BGRA color format since the bulk of libyuv functions works on that format.
2. Crop out a part of the full size image. The crop will be taken from the center of the vdo image and be as big as possible while still maintaining the WIDTH x HEIGHT aspect ratio. This crop will then be scaled to be of the same size as what the neural network requires (WIDTH x HEIGHT).
3. Lastly the scaled image will be converted from BGRA to interleaved RGB which is a common format for e.g. Mobilenet CNNs.

Finally larod will load a neural network model and start processing. It simply takes the images produced by vdo and libyuv and makes synchronous inferences calls to the neural network that was loaded. These function calls return when inferences are finished upon which the application parses the output tensor provided to print the top result to syslog/application log. The larod related code is found in "vdo_larod.c".

## Getting started
These instructions will guide you on how to execute the code. Below is the structure and scripts used in the example:

```bash

```

* **yuv/0001-Create-a-shared-library.patch** - Patch, which is needed to support building an .so file, for the shared library libyuv.

### Limitations
* ARTPEC-7 based device.
* This application was not written to optimize performance.
* MobileNet is good for classification, but it requires that the object you want to classify should cover almost all the frame.

### How to run the code
Below is the step by step instructions on how to execute the program. So basically starting with the generation of the .eap file to running it on a device:

#### Build the application

> [!IMPORTANT]
> *Depending on the network you are connected to,
The file that needs those settings is: *~/.docker/config.json.*
For reference please see: https://docs.docker.com/network/proxy/ and a
[script for Axis device here](../FAQs.md#HowcanIset-upnetworkproxysettingsontheAxisdevice?).*

Depending on selected chip, different model can be used for running larod. Label file is used for identifying objects in the video stream.

Model and label files are downloaded from https://coral.ai/models/, when building the application.

Which model that is used is configured through attributes in manifest.json and the CHIP parameter in the Dockerfile. 
The attributes in manifest.json that configures model are:
- runOptions, which contains the application command line options.
- friendlyName, a user friendly package name which is also part of the .eap file name.

The CHIP argument in the Dockerfile also needs to be changed depending on model. Supported values are cpu and edgetpu. This argument controls which files are to be included in the package e.g. model. These files are copied to the application directory during installation.

Different devices support different chips and models.

Building is done using the following commands:
```bash
cp app/manifest.conf.<CHIP> app/manifest.json
docker build --tag <APP_IMAGE> . --build-arg CHIP=<CHIP>
docker cp $(docker create <APP_IMAGE>):/opt/app ./build
```

\<APP_IMAGE\> is the name to tag the image with, e.g., vdo_larod_preprocessing:1.0

\<CHIP\> is the chip type. Supported values are cpu and edgetpu

Following is examples of how to build for both CPU with Tensorflow Lite and Google TPU.

Run the following command standing in your working directory to build larod for a CPU with TensorFlow Lite:
```bash
cp app/manifest.conf.cpu app/manifest.json
docker build --build-arg CHIP=cpu --tag <APP_IMAGE> .
docker cp $(docker create <APP_IMAGE>):/opt/app ./build
```
To build larod for a Google TPU instead, run the following command:
```bash
cp app/manifest.json.edgetpu app/manifest.json
docker build --build-arg CHIP=edgetpu --tag <APP_IMAGE> .
docker cp $(docker create <APP_IMAGE>):/opt/app ./build
```
The working dir now contains a build folder with the following files:

```bash
vdo-larod

│   ├── argparse.h
│   ├── imgconverter.c
│   ├── imgconverter.h

#### Install your application
Installing your application on an Axis video device is as simple as:

Browse to the following page (replace <axis_device_ip> with the IP number of your Axis video device)

```bash
http://<axis_device_ip>/#settings/apps
```

*Goto your device web page above > Click on the tab **App** in the device GUI > Add **(+)** sign and browse to
the newly built **vdo_larod_cpu_1_0_0_armv7hf.eap** or **vdo_larod_edgetpu_1_0_0_armv7hf.eap** > Click **Install** > Run the application by enabling the **Start** switch*

Application vdo_larod is now available as an application on the device,
using the friendly name "vdo_larod_cpu" or "vdo_larod_edgetpu".

#### The expected output
Application log can be found directly at:

```
http://<axis_device_ip>/axis-cgi/admin/systemlog.cgi?appname=vdo_larod
```

or by clicking on the "**App log**" link in the device GUI or by extracting the logs using following commands
in the terminal.
> [!IMPORTANT]
*> Please make sure SSH is enabled on the device to run the
following commands.*

```
ssh root@<axis_device_ip>
cd /var/log/
head -50 info.log
```

Depending on selected chip, different output is received. The label file is used for identifying objects.

##### Output Alternative Chip 2 - CPU with TensorFlow Lite

##### Conclusion
- This is an example of test data, which is dependant on selected device and chip.
- One full-screen banana has been used for testing.
- Running inference is much faster on chip Google TPU than CPU with TensorFlow Lite.
- Converting images takes almost the same time on both chips.
- Objects with score less than 60% are generally not good enough to be used as classification results.
